MATLAB/OCTAVE TRAINING CODE
-------------------------------------------------

The Matlab and Octave code in this directory can be used to train models
for the PartsBasedDetector. The code is a mirror of Yi Yang's code 
available at (with some modifications to support Octave):

    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~yyang8/research/pose/

Procedure to train a model:

    1) Start Octave or Matlab and cd to this matlab directory
    2) Run compile.m to compile the required mex files
    3) Annotate your training data. A simple utility called
       annotateParts() is provided for your clicking 
       convenience
    4) Create a training script. A sample training script
       training_demo.m is provided to outline the steps involved
    5) Run your script to train your model
